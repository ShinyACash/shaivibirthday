            <p1>Hello there!</p1> 
            <p>Since I won't be showing up to your birthday party or whatever you are doing to celebrate your birthday, 
            let's play a little game shall we?</p>
            <p>Well to get to the next webpage of this small hunt thingy, you gotta enter the answer or code to
            the url on your search bar on top!<p> 
            <p>If Ayush or Harsh are with you, they can explain this quite well considering they have done this kinda 
            thing before ( ';))' intended to them). If not, well jus add the answer on this url right after 'shaivibirthday/' and from there, keep adding your answer
            like:<p>  
            <p>shaivibirthday/answer1/answer2/answer3 and so on, hope you get it. What will you get after reaching the end you say? You'll get your bday 
            gift! Remember: No cheating.<p>
